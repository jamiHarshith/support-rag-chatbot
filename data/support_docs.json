Surveillance Measure is an initative by the regulatory bodies and exchanges to protect traders and investors by monitoring price and volatility and detecting misleading activities like insider trading, fictitious transactions, and more.\nWhat is ASM?\nSEBI (Securities and Exchange Board of India) along with the stock exchanges have initiated an Additional Surveillance Measure or ASM to safeguard investors’ interests by ensuring there are no market speculations or manipulations like unexpected price movements. The stocks are categorized under ASM for surveillance based on criteria specified by NSE\nhere\n.\nWhat is GSM?\nGSM or Graded Surveillance Measure is a system used by Indian Stock Exchanges like NSE and BSE to alert traders/investors and ask them to be extra cautious while dealing in certain securities which have been categorized under GSM. Scrips can be classified under GSM due to abnormal price hike that doesn’t match with the company’s financial health, are illiquid, have negligible market capital, and are underpreforming.\nWhat is the difference between ASM and GSM?\nThe main aim of the ASM framework is to control stock volatility, while the primary objective of GSM is to protect the investors from underperforming stocks by not allowing intraday trading and to advise them to be extra vigilant while dealing with securities that are witnessing unusual price fluctuations. Both these frameworks are introduced with different objectives, but their main goal is to protect traders and investors.\nWhat is the basis of categorizing a scrip under ASM?\nSEBI and Exchanges jointly decides the objective criterion to shortlist securities under ASM based on the following parameters:\n1. High Low Variation\n2. Client Concentration\n3. Close to Close Price Variation\n4. Market Capitalization\n5. Volume Variation\n6. Delivery Percentage\n7. No. of Unique PANs & PEs\nWhen will a scrip be classified under GSM?\nOn the basis of below-mentioned pointers, Regulatory Body and the Exchanges make their decision of adding a scrip under GSM category:\n1. Periodic Call Auction Session for Illiquid Securities\n2. Periodic Review of Movement of Securities to/from Trade for Trade\n3. Persistent Noise Creators\n4. Rumour Verification and Clarification in case of Spurt in Price/Volume\nWhen will a scrip get out of ASM/GSM?\nEvery 2 months in the case of ASM and every quarter in the case of GSM, the stock can go in and out of the list based on the review carried out by the exchange.\nWhat are the surveillance measures under ASM?\nPlease find the detailed surveillance measures under ASM\nhere\n.\nStill need help?\nCreate Ticket\nWant to connect with us?\nOur experts will be happy to assist you\nConnect with us\nStill have any queries?

Surveillance Measure is an initative by the regulatory bodies and exchanges to protect traders and investors by monitoring price and volatility and detecting misleading activities like insider trading, fictitious transactions, and more.\nWhat is ASM?\nSEBI (Securities and Exchange Board of India) along with the stock exchanges have initiated an Additional Surveillance Measure or ASM to safeguard investors’ interests by ensuring there are no market speculations or manipulations like unexpected price movements. The stocks are categorized under ASM for surveillance based on criteria specified by NSE\nhere\n.\nWhat is GSM?\nGSM or Graded Surveillance Measure is a system used by Indian Stock Exchanges like NSE and BSE to alert traders/investors and ask them to be extra cautious while dealing in certain securities which have been categorized under GSM. Scrips can be classified under GSM due to abnormal price hike that doesn’t match with the company’s financial health, are illiquid, have negligible market capital, and are underpreforming.\nWhat is the difference between ASM and GSM?\nThe main aim of the ASM framework is to control stock volatility, while the primary objective of GSM is to protect the investors from underperforming stocks by not allowing intraday trading and to advise them to be extra vigilant while dealing with securities that are witnessing unusual price fluctuations. Both these frameworks are introduced with different objectives, but their main goal is to protect traders and investors.\nWhat is the basis of categorizing a scrip under ASM?\nSEBI and Exchanges jointly decides the objective criterion to shortlist securities under ASM based on the following parameters:\n1. High Low Variation\n2. Client Concentration\n3. Close to Close Price Variation\n4. Market Capitalization\n5. Volume Variation\n6. Delivery Percentage\n7. No. of Unique PANs & PEs\nWhen will a scrip be classified under GSM?\nOn the basis of below-mentioned pointers, Regulatory Body and the Exchanges make their decision of adding a scrip under GSM category:\n1. Periodic Call Auction Session for Illiquid Securities\n2. Periodic Review of Movement of Securities to/from Trade for Trade\n3. Persistent Noise Creators\n4. Rumour Verification and Clarification in case of Spurt in Price/Volume\nWhen will a scrip get out of ASM/GSM?\nEvery 2 months in the case of ASM and every quarter in the case of GSM, the stock can go in and out of the list based on the review carried out by the exchange.\nWhat are the surveillance measures under ASM?\nPlease find the detailed surveillance measures under ASM\nhere\n.\nStill need help?\nCreate Ticket\nWant to connect with us?\nOur experts will be happy to assist you\nConnect with us\nStill have any queries?

For some of these stocks, trading may still be allowed subject to the stage of surveillance.\nInter Creditor Agreement (ICA):\nAn agreement between various lenders and a single borrower that describes their rights and obligations in case of a default is ICA.

A mismatch will result in your application being rejected by the bank.\nWhy are permissions to send SMS and access phone state required?\nThese permissions are needed to verify your mobile number by sending an SMS. Rest assured, these permissions are used solely for verification purposes.\nCan I link any SIM for FD purchase if I have a dual SIM phone?\nYes, you can. However, we recommend using the SIM registered with your bank account for authentication.\nCan I retry the registration if it was not successful earlier?\nYes, you can retry. Ensure you use the SIM linked to your bank account for authentication.\nCan I invest in FD if I do not have a PAN?\nNo, currently, we only process fixed deposit requests for individuals with an active PAN.\nWhy is my PAN not getting verified?\nFor booking fixed deposits, we need to verify your PAN with the regulated authorities. If there is a mismatch, the booking cannot be completed.\nWhat should I do if the name shown against my PAN is incorrect and I can't update it?\nThe name linked to your PAN should be accurate for successful identity verification and KYC purposes. Please update your name to match your PAN.\nWhy is my Aadhar required?\nAadhar is mandatory for identification and KYC setup for your account, necessary for processing your FD request.\nDo I need a physical copy of my Aadhar?\nNo, a physical copy is not required. We use secure platforms like DigiLocker and CKYC for verifying your Aadhar and other documents.\nWhat is DigiLocker?\nDigiLocker is a government initiative under the Digital India project for storing and verifying documents like PAN card, driving license, Aadhar card, school marksheets, and insurance papers.\nWhat should I do if there's a name mismatch and I can't complete the step?\nFor successful FD booking, the name on your Aadhar and PAN should match. Correct the details on either your PAN or Aadhar card and retry.\nHow can I add a new address as my current address?\nUse the “add” button on the address choice screen to add an address that is not listed.\nWhat should I do if I can't change my permanent address?\nThe address from your Aadhar is considered your permanent address. You may add or select your current address to proceed with the FD application.\nCan my permanent address be the same as my current address?\nYes, you can select your permanent address as your current address if they are the same.\nWhy is video KYC required?\nVideo KYC is required to complete the KYC verification step as mandated by the RBI.\nWhat if I am not available during bank working hours?\nIf you have made the payment, we will notify you when the bank officers are available. If video KYC is not completed within 3 days, your money will be refunded to your bank account.\nWhen can I complete the Video KYC?\nVideo KYC is available from Monday to Saturday, 09:00 AM to 08:00 PM. We will notify you to complete the video KYC during these hours if pending.\nWhat if video KYC fails?\nYou can retry during banking hours within 2 days of FD booking if your video KYC fails.\nHow will I know the status of my video KYC?\nYour video KYC details are verified by bank officers, which may take up to 3 hours. Track the video KYC and FD confirmation status on the ‘My Investments’ tab.\nWhat should I do if I can't move to the next step and complete my KYC verification?\nRetry using the correct details. If it still doesn’t work, try again later. If the issue persists, raise a ticket with our support team for assistance.\nWhy are details related to occupation, income, and family required for FD booking?\nThese details are required by the bank to create your fixed deposit and ensure communication if needed.\nWhy is my money deducted before video KYC?\nYour money is deducted before video KYC as it is the last step to verify your identity and book your FD. Your money is safe with the bank, and interest starts accumulating from the time of payment. In case of issues with VKYC, your money will be refunded within 7 working days.\nWhat is required for completing a video KYC?\nKeep your PAN Card and a blank paper with a pen ready for the VKYC process.\nStill need help?\nCreate Ticket\nWant to connect with us?\nOur experts will be happy to assist you\nConnect with us\nStill have any queries?

A mismatch will result in your application being rejected by the bank.\nWhy are permissions to send SMS and access phone state required?\nThese permissions are needed to verify your mobile number by sending an SMS. Rest assured, these permissions are used solely for verification purposes.\nCan I link any SIM for FD purchase if I have a dual SIM phone?\nYes, you can. However, we recommend using the SIM registered with your bank account for authentication.\nCan I retry the registration if it was not successful earlier?\nYes, you can retry. Ensure you use the SIM linked to your bank account for authentication.\nCan I invest in FD if I do not have a PAN?\nNo, currently, we only process fixed deposit requests for individuals with an active PAN.\nWhy is my PAN not getting verified?\nFor booking fixed deposits, we need to verify your PAN with the regulated authorities. If there is a mismatch, the booking cannot be completed.\nWhat should I do if the name shown against my PAN is incorrect and I can't update it?\nThe name linked to your PAN should be accurate for successful identity verification and KYC purposes. Please update your name to match your PAN.\nWhy is my Aadhar required?\nAadhar is mandatory for identification and KYC setup for your account, necessary for processing your FD request.\nDo I need a physical copy of my Aadhar?\nNo, a physical copy is not required. We use secure platforms like DigiLocker and CKYC for verifying your Aadhar and other documents.\nWhat is DigiLocker?\nDigiLocker is a government initiative under the Digital India project for storing and verifying documents like PAN card, driving license, Aadhar card, school marksheets, and insurance papers.\nWhat should I do if there's a name mismatch and I can't complete the step?\nFor successful FD booking, the name on your Aadhar and PAN should match. Correct the details on either your PAN or Aadhar card and retry.\nHow can I add a new address as my current address?\nUse the “add” button on the address choice screen to add an address that is not listed.\nWhat should I do if I can't change my permanent address?\nThe address from your Aadhar is considered your permanent address. You may add or select your current address to proceed with the FD application.\nCan my permanent address be the same as my current address?\nYes, you can select your permanent address as your current address if they are the same.\nWhy is video KYC required?\nVideo KYC is required to complete the KYC verification step as mandated by the RBI.\nWhat if I am not available during bank working hours?\nIf you have made the payment, we will notify you when the bank officers are available. If video KYC is not completed within 3 days, your money will be refunded to your bank account.\nWhen can I complete the Video KYC?\nVideo KYC is available from Monday to Saturday, 09:00 AM to 08:00 PM. We will notify you to complete the video KYC during these hours if pending.\nWhat if video KYC fails?\nYou can retry during banking hours within 2 days of FD booking if your video KYC fails.\nHow will I know the status of my video KYC?\nYour video KYC details are verified by bank officers, which may take up to 3 hours. Track the video KYC and FD confirmation status on the ‘My Investments’ tab.\nWhat should I do if I can't move to the next step and complete my KYC verification?\nRetry using the correct details. If it still doesn’t work, try again later. If the issue persists, raise a ticket with our support team for assistance.\nWhy are details related to occupation, income, and family required for FD booking?\nThese details are required by the bank to create your fixed deposit and ensure communication if needed.\nWhy is my money deducted before video KYC?\nYour money is deducted before video KYC as it is the last step to verify your identity and book your FD. Your money is safe with the bank, and interest starts accumulating from the time of payment. In case of issues with VKYC, your money will be refunded within 7 working days.\nWhat is required for completing a video KYC?\nKeep your PAN Card and a blank paper with a pen ready for the VKYC process.\nStill need help?\nCreate Ticket\nWant to connect with us?\nOur experts will be happy to assist you\nConnect with us\nStill have any queries?

You invest a lump sum of money at an agreed interest rate and receive the amount along with interest upon maturity. The interest rates are fixed, higher than a regular savings account, and the investment is protected from market fluctuations.\nIs it safe to invest in an FD?\nYes, FDs are one of the safest investment options. Unlike market-led investments where returns fluctuate, the returns on an FD are fixed at the time of investment. Even if FD interest rates change over time, your FD will grow at the rate you initially booked.\nWhat is DICGC and which deposits are secured by them?\nThe Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC) is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). It insures bank deposits, including savings, current, recurring, and fixed deposits, up to Rs. 5 lakh per account holder per bank. This insurance does not cover FDs with NBFCs.\nCan only banks offer fixed deposits?\nNo, fixed deposits are offered by banks, NBFCs, and the India Post Office. FDs with NBFCs, known as Corporate FDs, often offer higher interest rates compared to banks.\nWhat is an NBFC and do they also offer fixed deposits?\nA Non-Banking Financial Corporation (NBFC) operates as a financial institution without a full banking license, regulated by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs and the Reserve Bank of India. NBFCs offer services like savings, investment plans, lending schemes, insurance, and fixed deposits.\nWhat is the minimum and maximum amount I can invest in a fixed deposit?\nYou can start investing in fixed deposits with a minimum amount as low as INR 5000. The maximum amount varies based on the specific FD scheme you choose.\nIs it mandatory to add a nominee?\nNo, it is not mandatory to add a nominee, but it is recommended.\nCan I add a nominee who is less than 18 years old?\nYes, but you must provide the details of a guardian.\nWho can I add as a nominee?\nYou can add any individual as a nominee, including family members, relatives, friends, or any trusted person.\nCan I add or change a nominee later?\nYes, you can add or change a nominee later, but this service is currently available only with some partner banks. You will see the “Add Nominee” option on the dashboard once your FD is successfully booked.\nWhat is FD advice?\nFD advice is a computer-generated statement provided by the bank as proof of ownership or investment when you open a fixed deposit.\nI do not file taxes. Is there a way for TDS to not get deducted from the FD?\nCurrently, we do not offer a solution to avoid TDS deduction. Some banks allow the filing of forms 15G/15H, but we do not have this functionality. TDS is deducted only if the total interest from all sources with the bank exceeds Rs 40,000 for normal citizens and Rs 50,000 for senior citizens.\nHow are FDs taxed?\nInterest earnings from your fixed deposit are taxed according to your tax slab. For example, if you are in the 20% tax bracket and you earned Rs 6,000 interest from a 1-year FD of Rs 1 lakh at 6%, you will pay 20% of Rs 6,000, which is Rs 1,200, as tax.\nStill need help?\nCreate Ticket\nWant to connect with us?\nOur experts will be happy to assist you\nConnect with us\nStill have any queries?

This is the account where you will receive your money back.\nCan I add someone else's bank account details?\nNo, the payout account should belong to you. We do not allow the use of another person’s account for payout. Please use an account that is in your name.\nHow can I add my bank if it is not in the list?\nClick on the Search tab, enter your bank name, and you will be able to select your bank to add as the payout account for your fixed deposit.\nWhat should I do if my bank is inactive but my bank details are correct?\nYour payout account must be an active bank account for us to credit the money on maturity or withdrawal. If your bank status is inactive, either add another active bank account or check with your bank regarding your account status.\nWhy did I receive an SMS of INR 1 credit?\nWe verify your bank account by transferring INR 1. This verification process might result in an SMS from your bank informing you about the credit.\nWhat should I do if the bank servers are down?\nRetry after some time or use a different bank account.\nWhat if my payment fails?\nIf your payment fails and the amount is deducted, it will be refunded within 2-4 working days. You can place another request for an FD if you are still interested.\nWhy did my payment fail?\nThird-party limit error: Check your daily online transaction limit in your net banking, as exceeding this limit will cause the transaction to fail. UPI limit error: UPI transactions have a daily limit of Rs 1 lakh. Ensure you are not exceeding this limit. Bank connection error: Sometimes the connection to your bank’s page or UPI app page may break during payment, causing the transaction to fail.\nWhat should I do if I haven't received the refund yet?\nYour money is safe. If you haven’t received the refund within 7 working days, check your bank account statement for refund transactions and ensure 7 working days have passed.\nWhat should I do if I am stuck on the payment step and cannot understand the current status?\nClick on “Go to Dashboard” to track your FDs in the Pending Investments tab.\nWhat interest rate will I get in case of a premature withdrawal?\nFor premature withdrawal, the interest rate applicable will be for the tenure the FD was maintained. A penalty rate will also apply, and the net off penalty rate will be the applicable interest rate.\nWhen and where will I receive my money in case of a withdrawal?\nYou will receive your money within 2 working days after successfully placing withdrawal instructions to the account details provided during the FD booking process.\nAre there any withdrawal processing charges?\nNo, there are no withdrawal processing charges.\nHow will I know when my withdrawal is completed?\nYou will receive an SMS or notification from the bank regarding the crediting of money in your account.

Can I apply for an IPO?\nIn case you don’t have a UPI ID, you can create it with any of the UPI Handles featured in the NPCI list.\nAlternatively, you can apply through ASBA with your bank or through physical form.\nHow can I create my UPI ID?\nYou can follow the below steps to create a UPI ID with the BHIM app\nDownload the Google Pay/ PhonePe / BHIM App\nVerify your mobile number\nRegister the passcode (it is required to open the app)\nSelect your bank from the options available\nThe app will fetch your bank details\nIn case you have more than one account, choose the account you want to register with BHIM\nSet up a UPI PIN for security\nNow you can check your UPI ID in the profile section.\nWhy am I unable to apply for IPOs via my UPI ID/Handle?\nFor IPO applications, only UPI ID/Handles approved by NPCI are allowed.\nIn case you are unable to apply for IPO using your UPI ID/Handle, we recommend that you check the list of banks/apps approved by NPCI for providing UPI service for IPO application.\nWhy can’t I see my UPI handle listed in the dropdown in the Angel One app while applying for an IPO?\nIn case you can’t find your UPI Handle in the dropdown list on the IPO page in the Angel One app, it means your UPI Handle is not approved by NPCI for applying for an IPO.\nTry to use or create an alternative UPI ID with any of the entities featured on the NPCI list.\nWhen will I receive my UPI mandate request after placing an order?\nBelow are a few things you can do:\nGo to your Payment App – Navigate to the mandate section and check if you have an open mandate or not.\nIn case you have received many mandates then you can cross verify with the Application ID mentioned in the mandate details with the Application ID mentioned in the order details from Angel One’s Application\nOR\nMake sure your Payments App is updated.\nOR\nIf it is taking longer than 6 hours then cancel your bid from Angel one’s application and place a new bid.\nHow to approve an IPO mandate request?\nYou have to approve the IPO mandate request in your UPI app.\nBy when can I approve the UPI mandate request?\nPending mandates shall expire after 5 PM on the last day. So users should accept the mandate before 5 PM on the last day to participate in the IPO.\nWhat are the charges of applying for an IPO?\nWith Angel One, there are no charges to apply for an IPO.\nHow can an NRI apply for an IPO using the Angel One app?\nNRI’s can not apply via the Angel One app.\nHowever, they can apply through the physical ASBA (Application Supported By Blocked Amount) process with your bank.\nWhat is the cut-off price & why should I apply at a cut-off price?\nCut-off price is the price at which the shares get issued through an IPO to the investors.\nThis price is ascertained at the allotment stage.\nWhen an investor applies for an IPO at a cut-off price, that means he is ready to bid at this price.\nIn an ideal scenario, all retail investors bid at the cut-off price to increase their chance of allotment.\nCan I use a bank account not linked with Angel One to apply?\nYou can apply for an IPO using any other bank account provided the account is in the name of the investor.\nCan I apply for an IPO using my bank’s current account?\nIt is preferred that you apply using your savings account as most banks do not process IPO applications submitted using a current account.\nYou need to check with your bank for more details.\nCan I apply for an IPO using my HUF’s account?\nYou cannot apply via the Angel One app.\nHowever, you can apply using your HUF account through the physical ASBA process with your bank.\nMy daughter is a minor. Can I apply for an IPO using her account?\nThe Angel One app doesn’t allow a minor to apply.\nAlthough, a minor can apply via physical ASBA process through your bank.\nWhy didn’t my account get debited after applying for an IPO?\nAs per the ASBA process, banks will simply hold/block your money when you apply for an IPO.\nOnce the shares are allotted to you, the amount will be debited from your bank account.\nIf the shares are not allotted to you, the amount will be unblocked/released to your account on/before the UPI mandate expiry date.\nNote: Banks usually take 10-15 days to release your funds.\nIf your funds are still blocked after 15 days please contact your bank .\nCan I modify my IPO bid?\nYes, you can modify the lot size and UPI ID of your IPO bid after placing an order.\nPlease note that if you have approved your UPI mandate request for the order and modified the order later, the entire IPO bid amount will be blocked in addition to the amount blocked for your original IPO bid.\nYou will also receive another UPI mandate request for your modified bid.\nHowever, if you haven’t approved the original mandate request, no amount will be blocked for the original IPO bid.\nWhy is my IPO application rejected?\nFew of the common reasons your IPO application is rejected\nYou might have entered the wrong UPI ID or UPI PIN while approving the mandate\nEnsuring that the Bank A/c, Demat A/c, and UPI ID are mapped to the same PAN\nFor example: Jack is using Jill’s UPI ID to apply for an IPO with his Demat A/c. In such a case, Jack’s application will be rejected because\nJill’s bank account used is not linked to the demat account of Jack\nJill’s UPI ID used is not linked to Jack’s PAN\nWhen will my funds be blocked and unblocked?\nYour funds will be blocked once you approve the UPI mandate request for IPO.\nYour funds will be unblocked/released on or before the UPI mandate expiry date if the shares are not allotted through IPO.\nPlease reach out to your bank in case funds are not unblocked/released post the mandate expiry date.\nHow can I get a guaranteed IPO allotment?\nWe would like to explain that Angel One is merely a platform to apply for IPO and has no control over its allotment. IPO allotment can never be guaranteed since, in case of over-subscription, the allotment is done via a lottery system. However, you can avoid application rejection by\nApplying from only 1 Demat account per PAN\nApplying at cut-off price\nEnsuring that the Bank A/c, Demat A/c, and UPI ID are mapped to the same PAN\nFor example: Jack is using Jill’s UPI ID to apply for an IPO with his Demat A/c. In such a case, Jack’s application will be rejected because\nJill’s bank A/C used is not linked to the Demat A/c of Jack\nJill’s UPI ID used is not linked to Jack’s PAN\nWhere can I check my refund status in case of a rejected/non-allotted IPO application?\nBanks will simply hold/block your money when you apply for an IPO.\nSo, your funds will be released/unblocked on or before the UPI mandate expiry date.\nPlease reach out to your bank in case funds are not unblocked or released post the mentioned date.\nWhy didn’t I get my IPO allotment?\nCommon reasons why you didn’t get the allotment are\nNon-Allotment – Allotment is done through lottery system because of over-subscription\nRejection – Application can be rejected due to either of the following reasons:\n1) Application received from multiple Demat accounts having the same PAN\n2) Bank account Demat account, and UPI ID used for an application not mapped to the same PAN\n3) Your bid price is lower than the final issue price\nIs tax applicable on profit from an IPO?\nTax will be levied on your profit as per your tax bracket.\nWhen is the next IPO coming?\nVisit our website https://www.angelone.in/upcoming-IPO to get all information about forthcoming IPO’s.\nI have approved the mandate request, but the status on the Angel One app is still pending. What to do?\nYour UPI mandate request status on the Angel One app does not get updated in real-time.\nIt will reflect shortly in your IPO order book.\nCan I withdraw/delete/cancel my IPO bid?\nFor an IPO application process in the Angel One app, withdrawing, deleting, and canceling the application is the same thing.\nFollow the below path to withdraw/cancel your IPO application\nTap on IPO on the Home page\nClick on IPO orders & click on the IPO Order you wish to cancel\nTap on cancel & confirm to cancel your IPO Order\nHow can I check my IPO application status?\nFollow the below path to check your IPO application status\nTap on IPO on the Home page\nClick on IPO orders & click on the IPO Order for which you want to check the application status\nYour IPO application status will be visible from here\nWhere to check the IPO allotment status?\nFollow the below path to check your subscription status\nTap on IPO on the Home page\nClick on IPO orders & click on the IPO Order for which you want to check the subscription status\nYour IPO subscription status will be visible from here\nCan I submit multiple applications for an IPO?\nOnly 1 application per PAN is recommended. Even if you apply via different platforms using the same PAN, your application will be rejected and you will not get the IPO allotment. However, you can increase the chances of IPO allotment by applying with different account linked to different PAN. For example, you can apply with your and your parents demat account separately.\nStill need help?\nCreate Ticket\nWant to connect with us?\nOur experts will be happy to assist you\nConnect with us\nStill have any queries?

In such a case, Jack’s application will be rejected because\nJill’s bank account used is not linked to the demat account of Jack\nJill’s UPI ID used is not linked to Jack’s PAN\nWhen will my funds be blocked and unblocked?\nYour funds will be blocked once you approve the UPI mandate request for IPO.\nYour funds will be unblocked/released on or before the UPI mandate expiry date if the shares are not allotted through IPO.\nPlease reach out to your bank in case funds are not unblocked/released post the mandate expiry date.\nHow can I get a guaranteed IPO allotment?\nWe would like to explain that Angel One is merely a platform to apply for IPO and has no control over its allotment. IPO allotment can never be guaranteed since, in case of over-subscription, the allotment is done via a lottery system. However, you can avoid application rejection by\nApplying from only 1 Demat account per PAN\nApplying at cut-off price\nEnsuring that the Bank A/c, Demat A/c, and UPI ID are mapped to the same PAN\nFor example: Jack is using Jill’s UPI ID to apply for an IPO with his Demat A/c. In such a case, Jack’s application will be rejected because\nJill’s bank A/C used is not linked to the Demat A/c of Jack\nJill’s UPI ID used is not linked to Jack’s PAN\nWhere can I check my refund status in case of a rejected/non-allotted IPO application?\nBanks will simply hold/block your money when you apply for an IPO.\nSo, your funds will be released/unblocked on or before the UPI mandate expiry date.\nPlease reach out to your bank in case funds are not unblocked or released post the mentioned date.\nWhy didn’t I get my IPO allotment?\nCommon reasons why you didn’t get the allotment are\nNon-Allotment – Allotment is done through lottery system because of over-subscription\nRejection – Application can be rejected due to either of the following reasons:\n1) Application received from multiple Demat accounts having the same PAN\n2) Bank account Demat account, and UPI ID used for an application not mapped to the same PAN\n3) Your bid price is lower than the final issue price\nIs tax applicable on profit from an IPO?\nTax will be levied on your profit as per your tax bracket.\nWhen is the next IPO coming?\nVisit our website https://www.angelone.in/upcoming-IPO to get all information about forthcoming IPO’s.\nI have approved the mandate request, but the status on the Angel One app is still pending. What to do?\nYour UPI mandate request status on the Angel One app does not get updated in real-time.\nIt will reflect shortly in your IPO order book.\nCan I withdraw/delete/cancel my IPO bid?\nFor an IPO application process in the Angel One app, withdrawing, deleting, and canceling the application is the same thing.\nFollow the below path to withdraw/cancel your IPO application\nTap on IPO on the Home page\nClick on IPO orders & click on the IPO Order you wish to cancel\nTap on cancel & confirm to cancel your IPO Order\nHow can I check my IPO application status?\nFollow the below path to check your IPO application status\nTap on IPO on the Home page\nClick on IPO orders & click on the IPO Order for which you want to check the application status\nYour IPO application status will be visible from here\nWhere to check the IPO allotment status?\nFollow the below path to check your subscription status\nTap on IPO on the Home page\nClick on IPO orders & click on the IPO Order for which you want to check the subscription status\nYour IPO subscription status will be visible from here\nCan I submit multiple applications for an IPO?\nOnly 1 application per PAN is recommended. Even if you apply via different platforms using the same PAN, your application will be rejected and you will not get the IPO allotment. However, you can increase the chances of IPO allotment by applying with different account linked to different PAN. For example, you can apply with your and your parents demat account separately.\nStill need help?\nCreate Ticket\nWant to connect with us?\nOur experts will be happy to assist you\nConnect with us\nStill have any queries?

The balance amount is funded by the broker.\nAs an illustration\nYour Account Balance = Rs. 25,000\nMTF gives you upto 4x buying power = Rs 100,000 (25,000 x 4)\nThus, your enhanced Buying Capacity is now = Rs. 125,000.\nWhat is Margin required?\nMargin required is the amount you need to pay initially to buy stocks under margin products.\nMargin amount can be paid either in the form of Cash, or by pledging your holdings (margin pledge).\nWhat happens if the margin is less?\nIn order to buy stocks under Margin Trading Facility, you need to fulfil the Minimum Margin requirement.\nIf your margin is less than that, then you will have to add funds to proceed with your transaction.\nWhat is the interest rate charged for using MTF?\nA standard interest rate of 0.041% per day (14.97% per annum) is charged on the borrowed amount.\nHow long can I hold the stocks purchased via MTF?\nIn case you have pledged the shares, you can hold them as long as you want unless you either sell your Pay Later (MTF) positions or convert them to delivery by adding funds.\nWhen will I start incurring interest charges?\nInterest is levied from the 2nd day onwards after you placed an MTF trade, till the outstanding amount is cleared, and/or your position is squared-off.\nWhat is MTF Pledge?\nAs per SEBI guidelines,\nyour shares bought using\nPayLater\n(MTF) will be automatically pledged\n. There is no action needed from your end\nWhen would my shares purchased under MTF be squared-off?\nFor shares purchased under MTF, square-off will be triggered in either of the below scenarios:\nIf there is a margin shortfall, shares will be squared-off 4 trading days after the shortfall has occurred.\nWhat are the charges for Pledging/Un-pledging shares under MTF?\nWhen you raise a request to Pledge or Unpledge your shares, charge of Rs 20/- plus GST is levied per scrip.\nHow is MTF Pledge different from Margin Pledge?\nMargin Pledge means using your existing holdings / portfolio to get additional limit / margin. You can then use this additional margin for Equity Intraday, futures & options writing (equity and currency F&O).\nAs per SEBI guidelines, shares bought under MTF have to be compulsorily pledged. This is called MTF pledge. Unlike Margin Pledge, you do not get additional limit against these shares.\nCan Margin Trading Facility be used for trading in Futures & Options, Currency, or Commodity segment?\nNo. MTF Facility is applicable for trading in equity shares only.\nI do not want to use Margin Facility. What should I do?\nIf you do not wish to use Margin facility you can place orders using Delivery product type.\nKindly make sure that you have adequate funds before placing your Order.\nKindly check your available funds in the Account -> Trading Balance Summary\nStill need help?\nCreate Ticket\nWant to connect with us?\nOur experts will be happy to assist you\nConnect with us\nStill have any queries?

Investors should refer to their respective SCSB’s website for detailed instructions on applying for the Rights Issue.\nOffline ASBA Process:\nAlternatively, investors can apply by submitting a filled application form\nat the nearest branch of an SCSB (Self Certified Syndicate Bank). The list of eligible branches is available on the\nSEBI website\n.\nThe Composite Application form\n(CAF) can be downloaded from\nNSE, BSE\nand\nRTA\nwebsites.\nInvestors can also view and download the Rights Issue Application Form\n(CAF)\n, Offer Letter,\nAbridged Letter & Entitlement Ratio\n– Applicable only for registered holders with holdings as of Record Date, from the RTA website. RTA don’t directly accept Right Issue application forms (online/offline). Application needs to be channeled through SCSBs only.\nHow to obtain the Right Entitlement (RE) ?\nDirectly from RTA\nif the investor is eligible for the Right Issue by holding shares of the Company on\nthe record date\n.\nPurchasing from the Market\n– Investors can buy Right Entitlement (RE) from the secondary market through the trading platforms such as Angel One, generally identifiable with “-RE” at the end of the stock symbol.\nImportant Note:\nHolding or purchasing Right Entitlement (RE) does not automatically grant ownership of the Rights Issue shares. Investors must apply for the Rights Issue using their RE before the application deadline. Failure to do so will result in the renouncement of rights, leading to a loss of value.\nThe RTA website is only for viewing the Rights Issue Application Form, Offer Letter, Abridged Letter & Entitlement Ratio – Applicable only for registered holders with holdings as of Record Date.\nStill need help?\nCreate Ticket\nWant to connect with us?\nOur experts will be happy to assist you\nConnect with us\nStill have any queries?

Also, within each basket, a maximum of 20 securities can be added.\nIs there any charge for placing a Basket Order?\nNo, there is no additional charge for placing a Basket Order. You just have to pay the existing brokerage for the orders in the basket.\nIs there any specific time to place a Basket Order?\nBasket Orders can be placed only within the market hours i.e., between 9:15 am and 3:15 pm. However, you can create and save the basket anytime during the day.\nCan I clone my basket?\nYes, you can clone your existing baskets. Additionally, you can also clone any order inside the basket.\nHow to check the required margin for placing the Basket Order?\nThe required margin and the available margin will be shown upfront in the Basket. To give you the margin benefit, the required margin for the entire basket will be calculated using the SPAN calculator.\nWhat if the available margin is less than the required margin?\nYou can add the funds with the ‘Add Funds’ feature within the Basket to match the required margin.\nWhat will happen to my basket after execution?\nAfter placing the Basket Order, the status of individual orders will be shown inside the basket. You can take decisions at the individual order level like modifying a pending order or retrying a failed order.\nCan I see my placed Basket Order the next day?\nIf you have saved your basket, then you can see it the next day, but the orders will be reset to the initial state i.e., before placing the Basket Order. However, you won’t be able to see the status of the orders. Please know that if you don’t manually save the basket, it will not appear in the Baskets Tab.\nWhat is the margin benefit in the Basket?\nWhen you place individual orders, you do not get a hedging benefit and have to pay the entire required margin upfront. But when you hedge your position in the basket (i.e. combine 2 or more orders), you get the benefit of hedging in terms of lower required margin.\nCan the basket save time in order execution?\nYou can save time using Basket Order as multiple orders are placed in one click.

With an already pending stop-loss or exit order, you will need extra funds to be able to place a duplicate SL/exit order. If you do not have this extra fund in your account, then your duplicate exit order will get rejected. That’s why we inform you while exiting if there’s a Pending SL/exit order against a position, to avoid any duplicate orders and rejections.\nMy Stop-Loss (SL) order was triggered but it did not get executed. Why did this happen?\nThere could be 2 major reasons behind this:\nThe asset may be lacking a buyer/seller at the defined stop-loss limit price due to a lack of market depth. Orders are queued while they are being purchased or sold.\na. For example:\nLet’s say there are 50 buyers and 100 sellers who are waiting to trade on a scrip at ₹90. Upon reaching ₹90, the first 50 sellers’ orders will be executed, and the remaining 50 sellers will have to wait for new buyers. In case you are one of those remaining 50 sellers, your\nsell order\nwill remain pending if there are no corresponding buyers and vice versa.\nThe price movement during high volatility does not fulfill certain criteria e.g. suppose you have placed a\nsell stop-loss\nwith trigger Price at\n₹100\nand limit price at ₹100. Now imagine that the LTP touched ₹100 (here, the SL would be triggered) and quickly went below ₹100 due to high volatility. The limit price of ₹100 means the stop-loss order would get executed at only ₹100 or more. Now this order will be pending as price is below Rs 100 and execution will happen only when price has reached or crossed Rs 100. Hence your stop-loss order was not executed.\nDue to this reason, we recommend keeping a sufficient gap between the trigger price and limit price to increase the chances of Stop Loss execution during high volatility.\nNote:\nIn order to increase the chances of execution, we keep the default value of the limit price 2 ticks away from the trigger price. This is done so that if the LTP moves rapidly after triggering the order, the limit price shouldn’t be a hindrance and the order should still get executed. Also, if you change the pre-set limit price and bring it closer to the Trigger Price, the chances of execution can reduce in cases of volatility.\nMy stop-loss order got triggered even though the predefined Trigger Price had not appeared. Why?\nChances are that the market price did hit the stop-loss price, albeit momentarily and without you being able to spot it at that moment. Within a second, prices can change multiple times and not all of them are relayed to the Brokers by Exchange, especially during high volatility. As a result, such momentary price fluctuations are not seen anywhere.\nPrice matching and execution of the orders  is done by the Exchanges and not the Broker.\nWhat is Stop Loss?\nStop-loss is a tool that investors use to minimise the loss in a trade. Some traders define it as an advance order, which triggers an automatic closure of an open position when the stock price reaches the trigger price level.\nStop loss helps minimise losses but also limit profits from a trade.\nWhat is Trailing Stop Loss?\nA Trailing Stop-loss is an order that lets you set a maximum value or percentage of loss you can incur on a trade. If the securiy price rises or falls in your favour, the trigger price jumps with it at the set value or percentage. If the security price rises or falls against you, the trigger price stays in place depending on the nature of the order.\nHow does a Stop-loss get triggered?\nStop-loss can be your real saviour during a volatile market condition. A price level set at the beginning of the trade allows traders to close their position automatically when the stop-loss is reached. Squaring off takes place at the next price available at the trigger price level and helps limit losses.\nWhat is the 1% rule of trading?\nThe 1% rule defines the maximum limit of risk one can take in a trade or the risk-per-trade. It implies adjusting your position so that total loss doesn’t cross 1% of your trade value when the stop-loss is triggered. The 1% rule helps avoid significant losses.\nCan I use stop-loss in trading with the AngelOne Trading app?\nYou can place a Stop loss order  in AngelOne mobile app by following the below simple steps:\nVisit the AngelOne app and select the stock to Buy/Sell\nSelect quantity of the trade\nSet’ Trigger price’\nEnter the price where you want to place stop-loss\nConfirm the stop-loss price, click on “Buy/Sell” and confirm the order\nStill need help?\nCreate Ticket\nWant to connect with us?\nOur experts will be happy to assist you\nConnect with us\nStill have any queries?

Orders are queued while being bought or sold. For Example. Assume you placed a Buy limit order of 100 Rs for the ABC script. Let’s say there are 100 buyers and 50 sellers waiting to trade in ABC at 100. ABC is currently trading at 105 Rs and after a few minutes, it reaches 100 Rs. Since there are only 50 sellers for 100 Rs, only 50 buyers will be able to buy the script once this price is reached.
